<p>Google Wave was a software framework centered on online real-time collaborative editing, previously developed by Google. It was first announced at the Google I/O conference on May 27, 2009. Google Wave is a web-based computing platform and communications protocol, designed to merge key features of media like e-mail, instant messaging, wikis, and social networking. Communications using the system can be synchronous and/or asynchronous, depending on the preference of individual users. Software extensions provide contextual spelling/grammar checking, automated translation among 40 languages, and numerous other features.</p>
<p><a href="#" id="inline-count-1" class="inline-count">4 notes</a>Initially released only to developers, a preview release of Google Wave<span class="inline-sup">1</span> was extended to 100,000 users in September 2009, each allowed to invite additional users<span class="inline-sup">2</span>. Google accepted most requests submitted starting November 29, 2009, soon after the September extended release of the technical preview. On May 19, 2010, Google Wave was released to the general public.</p>

  <li><span>How many invites do you have left?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#" class="inline-count">1 note</a>On August 4, 2010, Google announced the suspension of stand-alone Wave development and the intent of maintaining the web site at least for the remainder of the year.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection"><a href="/w/index.php?title=Google_Wave&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Features">Edit</a></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Features">Features</span></h2>
<p>Google Wave was a new <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> <a href="/wiki/Communications" title="Communications" class="mw-redirect">communications</a> platform. It was written in <a href="/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a> using <a href="/wiki/OpenJDK" title="OpenJDK">OpenJDK</a> and its web interface used the <a href="/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit" title="Google Web Toolkit">Google Web Toolkit</a>. Google Wave works like previous messaging systems such as <a href="/wiki/Email" title="Email">email</a> and <a href="/wiki/Usenet" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>, but instead of sending a message along with its entire thread of previous messages, or requiring all responses to be stored in each user's inbox for context, message documents (referred to as <i>waves</i>) that contain complete threads of multimedia messages (blips) are perpetually stored on a central server. Waves are shared with collaborators who can be added or removed from the wave at any point during a wave's existence.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="inline-count">[2]</a>Waves, described by Google as "<i>equal parts conversation and document</i>", are hosted <a href="/wiki/XML" title="XML">XML</a> documents that allow seamless and low latency concurrent modifications.<sup id="cite_ref-ot_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ot-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Any participant of a wave can reply anywhere within the message, edit any part of the wave, and add participants at any point in the process. Each edit/reply is a blip and users can reply to individual blips within waves. Recipients are notified of changes/replies in all waves in which they are active and, upon opening a wave, may review those changes in chronological order. In addition, waves are live. All replies/edits are visible in real-time, letter-by-letter, as they are typed by the other collaborators. Multiple participants may edit a single wave simultaneously in Google Wave. Thus, waves can function not only as e-mails and <a href="/wiki/Threaded_discussion" title="Threaded discussion" class="mw-redirect">threaded conversations</a> but also as an <a href="/wiki/Instant_messaging" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a> service when many participants are online at the same time. A wave may repeatedly shift roles between e-mail and instant messaging depending on the number of users editing it concurrently. The ability to show messages as they are typed can be disabled, similar to conventional instant messaging.<sup id="cite_ref-aboutgw_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-aboutgw-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The ability to modify a wave at any location lets users create collaborative documents, <a href="/wiki/Collaborative_editing" title="Collaborative editing">edited</a> in a manner akin to <a href="/wiki/Wiki" title="Wiki">wikis</a>. Waves can easily link to other waves. It is in many respects a more advanced forum.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> A wave can be read and known to exist by only one person, or by two or more. It can also be public, e added, and who was responsible for what in the wave.<sup id="cite_ref-aboutgw_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-aboutgw-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-gwdevblog_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gwdevblog-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The history may also be searched by a user to view and/or modify specific changes, such as specific kinds of changes or messages from a single user.<sup id="cite_ref-iokeynote_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iokeynote-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Google will stop wave services soon, it has already put an end to the development activities."Wave has not seen the user adoption we would have liked," Senior Vice President Urs Holzle said in the blog post. "We don't plan to continue developing Wave as a standalone product, but we will maintain the site, at least through the end of the year, and extend the technology for use in other Google projects."</p>

<p>The science fiction television series <i><a href="/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29" title="Firefly (TV series)">Firefly</a></i> provided the inspiration for the project's name.<sup id="cite_ref-itnewsau_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-itnewsau-9"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> In the series, a <i>wave</i> is an electronic communication, often consisting of a <a href="/wiki/Video_call" title="Video call" class="mw-redirect">video call</a> or video message.<sup id="cite_ref-itnewsau_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-itnewsau-9"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> During the developer preview, a number of references were made to the series, such as <a href="/wiki/Lars_Rasmussen_%28Software_Developer%29" title="Lars Rasmussen (Software Developer)" class="mw-redirect">Lars Rasmussen</a> replying to a message with "shiny", a word commonly used in the series to mean <i>cool</i> or <i>good</i>, and the crash message of Wave being a popular quotation from the series: "Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"<sup id="cite_ref-iokeynote_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iokeynote-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Another common error message, "Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret!" is a quote from <a href="/wiki/Kaylee_Frye" title="Kaylee Frye" class="mw-redirect">Kaylee Frye</a> in the 2005 motion-picture <i>Firefly</i> continuation, <i><a href="/wiki/Serenity_%28film%29" title="Serenity (film)">Serenity</a></i>, and it is matched with a sign declaring that "This wave is experiencing some turbulence and might explode. If you don't want to explode..." which is another reference to the opening of the film.</p>
<p>During an event in Amsterdam, Netherlands, it became apparent that the 60-strong team that was currently working on Wave in Sydney, Australia, use Joss Whedon-related references to describe, among others, the sandbox version of Wave, called Dollhouse after the TV-series by Firefly producer Joss Whedon, which was aired on Fox in the U.S. The development of external extensions is codenamed "Serenity", after the spaceship used in Firefly and Serenity.M</p>

<p>Google Wave provides <a href="/wiki/Federation_%28information_technology%29" title="Federation (information technology)">federation</a> using an extension of <a href="/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol" title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol">XMPP</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Open_standard" title="Open standard">open</a> <a href="/wiki/Google_Wave_Federation_Protocol" title="Google Wave Federation Protocol">Wave Federation Protocol</a>.

Google hopes that waves may replace e-mail as the dominant form of Internet communication.<sup id="cite_ref-iokeynote_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iokeynote-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-gwarchitecture_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gwarchitecture-12"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wpcsmodel_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wpcsmodel-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> In this way, Google intends to be only one of many wave providers.<sup id="cite_ref-iokeynote_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iokeynote-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-gwarchitecture_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gwarchitecture-12"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wpcsmodel_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wpcsmodel-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> It can also be used as a supplement to <a href="/wiki/E-mail" title="E-mail" class="mw-redirect">e-mail</a>, <a href="/wiki/Instant_messaging" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a>, <a href="/wiki/FTP" title="FTP" class="mw-redirect">FTP</a>, etc.</p>
<p>A key feature of the protocol is that waves are stored on the service provider's servers instead of being sent between users. Waves are federated; copies of waves and wavelets are distributed by the wave provider of the originating user to the providers of all other participants in a particular wave or wavelet so all participants have immediate access to up-to-date content. The originating wave server is responsible for hosting, processing, and concurrency control of waves.<sup id="cite_ref-gwarchitecture_12-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gwarchitecture-12"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wpcsmodel_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wpcsmodel-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The protocol allows private reply wavelets within parent waves, where other participants have no access or knowledge of them.<sup id="cite_ref-gwarchitecture_12-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gwarchitecture-12"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wpcsmodel_13-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wpcsmodel-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Security for the communications is provided via <a href="/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Transport Layer Security">Transport Layer Security</a> authentication, and encrypted connections and waves/wavelets are identified uniquely by a service provider's <a href="/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name">domain name</a> and ID strings. User-data is not federated, that is, not shared with other wave providers.</p>
<h4><span class="editsection"><a href="/w/index.php?title=Google_Wave&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Robots">Edit</a></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Robots">Robots</span></h4>
<p>A robot is an automated participant on a wave. They read the contents of a wave in which it participates, modify the wave's contents, add or remove participants, and create new blips and new waves. Robots perform actions in response to events. For example, a robot might publish the contents of a wave to a public <a href="/wiki/Blog" title="Blog">blog</a> site and update the wave with user comments.</p>
<p>Robots may be added as participants to the Wave itself (they may appear as a contact person in the wave). In theory, a robot can be added anywhere a human participant can be involved.</p>
<h4><span class="editsection"><a href="/w/index.php?title=Google_Wave&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Gadgets">Edit</a></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gadgets">Gadgets</span></h4>
<p>Gadget extensions are applications that run within the wave, and to which all participants have access. Robots and Gadgets can be used together, but they generally serve different purposes. A gadget is an application users could participate with, many of which are built on Google’s <a href="/wiki/OpenSocial" title="OpenSocial">OpenSocial</a> platform. A good comparison would be iGoogle gadgets or Facebook applications.</p>
<p>The gadget is triggered based on the user action. They can be best described as applications installed on a mobile phone. For example, a wave might include a <a href="/wiki/Sudoku" title="Sudoku">sudoku</a> gadget that lets the wave participants compete to see who can solve the puzzle first.</p>
<p>Gadgets may be added to individual waves and all the participants share and interact with the gadget.</p>
